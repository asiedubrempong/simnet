# Simple Neural Network - simNet

[nn.ipynb](https://github.com/asiedubrempong/simnet/blob/master/nn.ipynb)
Implementation of Stochastic Gradient Descent and backpropagation in python.

Model is tested on the MNIST dataset.


[nn_improved.ipynb](https://github.com/asiedubrempong/simnet/blob/master/nn_improved.ipynb)
An improvement to nn.ipynb adding in the following features:
- cost function is changed from the quadratic cost function to use the cross entropy cost function
- Regularization using L2 regularization
- Weights are initialised with mean 0 and standard deviation 1/sqrt(n.in)

[Michael Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) - for his wonderful book from which I obviously took many ideas.
